Weather-Storm
===

The Elma Weather Storm uses the [Elam](https://github.com/klavinslab/elma) library as its infrastructure to implement an event loop process manager for raspberry pi to read weather related data from online sources and use that to create visual indications, such as blinking LEDs and or turning a stepper motor. In addition, I will be using the [http.h](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) library and [json.h](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) library for this project. In order to succeed in this project, I must be able to run Elma on a raspberry pi which may seem simple, but I have no experience using raspberry pi. Additional goals of this project are getting weather related data of Seattle from an online server such as Google. Finally, the ultimate success in this project is achieved by turning this information into visual responses using the raspberry pi. These visual responses could be as simple as blinking an LED every 2 minutes as many times as the current temperature in Fahrenheit. I have also found a stepper motor and a switching power supply that I can use to create a more visual outputs with; however, I would need a stepper drive that works well with raspberry pi, so if time allows, I will be adding that functionality. An example of a complete project can be a loop where latest Seattleâ€™s temperature is pulled from an online server then the stepper rotates as many steps as the current temperature of Seattle and finally the system sleeps for one minute.
The source code for this project is available [on github](https://github.com/Pnaghavi/Weather-Storm).
